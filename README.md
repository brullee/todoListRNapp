# Simple Todo List App

This is a simple Todo list app I built with **Expo** while learning the basics of **React Native**.

## Key Learnings & Concepts Applied:
While building this app, I revised and learned the following React Native concepts:

- **Basic Components**: `View`, `Text`, `StyleSheet`, `Image`, `Pressable`, `Button`
- **State Management**: `useState` for managing states
- **Props**: Passing data between components, including functions and states
- **List Rendering**: Handling lists with `ScrollView` and `FlatList`, including key assignment and management
- **User Interface Elements**: Using `StatusBar` for controlling the status bar, and `Modal` for modal dialogs
- **JavaScript Features**: Using the **Spread Operator** for copying and merging objects/arrays
- **Array Transformation**: Applying methods like `filter()` to transform and manipulate data
- **Dynamic Imports**: Using `require()` for static asset imports
- **Event Binding**: Utilizing `.bind()` to handle event context
- **Building Custom Components**: Creating reusable and modular components to structure the app

This project helped me reinforce these concepts and serve as a foundation for more complex React Native projects in the future.
